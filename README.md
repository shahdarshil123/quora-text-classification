#### Description

An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.

Quora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions -- those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.

In this competition, I develop models that identified and flaged insincere questions. To date, Quora has employed both machine learning and manual review to address this problem.

Here's your chance to combat online trolls at scale. Help Quora uphold their policy of “Be Nice, Be Respectful” and continue to be a place for sharing and growing the world’s knowledge.

An insincere question is defined as a question intended to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. Some characteristics that can signify that a question is insincere:

Has a non-neutral tone
Has an exaggerated tone to underscore a point about a group of people
Is rhetorical and meant to imply a statement about a group of people
Is disparaging or inflammatory
Suggests a discriminatory idea against a protected class of people, or seeks confirmation of a stereotype
Makes disparaging attacks/insults against a specific person or group of people
Based on an outlandish premise about a group of people
Disparages against a characteristic that is not fixable and not measurable
Isn't grounded in reality
Based on false information, or contains absurd assumptions
Uses sexual content (incest, bestiality, pedophilia) for shock value, and not to seek genuine answers
